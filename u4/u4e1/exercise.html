In this exercise you must create two different classes, which derive
from the Bird class. This class is declared in <strong>bird.hh</strong>.
</p>

<p>You must implement two new classes, <strong>Duck</strong>, in <strong>duck.hh</strong>,
and <strong>Owl</strong>, in <strong>owl.hh</strong>. These classes inherit from 
Bird, and they implement the <strong>speak()</strong> member function.
</p>

<p>When a owl speaks, it prints out its name and the text WHUU delimited
by : to the output stream. When a duck speaks, it prints out its name and the 
text QUACK delimited by : to the output stream. Both messages are terminated by
the newline character. For example, if a Duck called "Matti" spoke to std::cout, the text
"Matti: QUACK" would be printed to the standard output.
</p>

<p>You must also implement the class <strong>Aviary</strong>, which is used to house
different kinds of birds. The header file stub <strong>aviary.hh</strong> can be downloaded
from this page. You must fill it and return both the header file and its implementation in <strong>aviary.cc</strong>.
The header file has more specific instructions.
</p>

<p>We will also give you a very simple test program to test your classes.
</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li>To get operator[] to work with both const and nonconst aviaries, you must actually
implement it twice. The return value must be a pointer to Bird.
</li>
<li>The member function <strong>addBird()</strong> takes its parameter as a pointer to 
prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicing">object slicing</a>.
</li>
<li>If somebody tries to copy an instance of Aviary, the compilation must fail.
It is your job to make this happen.
</li>

</ul>
